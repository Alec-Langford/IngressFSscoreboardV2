MARCH PA03-ROMEO-11 SITREP<br/>
Our Canberra and surrounds (Cell PA03-ROMEO-11) March 2015 First Saturday #IngressFS started at the Rivett Community Park and end at the National Arboretum, ACT, Australia. We had 31 agents register.
It was a glorious day for ingress in Australia's capital. We kicked stuff off in style donning ingress tattoos, starting our FS mission and saying g'day to each other.
Agents were invited this month to donate old computer games to support Lifeline. A huge thank you to the agents who donated. Some real classics are going to a great new home. #Missionsforgood
We wrapped up our day up enjoying the Canberra skyline views at the National Arboretum. To mix things up agents discovered that the glyph on their name tag had a matching one on the opposing faction tags. The challenge was set to find your counterpart and take a FS selfie which would earn you some swag. #Ingressmiles
